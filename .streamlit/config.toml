# What's missing/doesn't look great:
# - sidebar shadow instead of border
# - border around dataframe is a bit too light
# - large elements are too rounded
# - they also have a secondary color defined
# - they also have colors for info/warning/etc
# - they have a separate heading font (Poppins)
# - they have smaller top padding
# - their expander is colored
